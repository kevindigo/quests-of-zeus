- Make sea hexes a paler blue
- You keep trying "Let me run our test file directly:" or "Let me run the test
  directly with Deno:" but often those will start the server, which hangs. So I
  have to terminate it manually. Should you create some different deno task that
  you will know to use when you want to run tests?
